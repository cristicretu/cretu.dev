luck is a concept that is often misunderstood. it is not a mystical force that randomly bestows good fortune upon people.
a lot of 'overnight successes' are actually months, years, decades in the making.

focus on yourself - grow, fail, fail, fail, and fail, learn and never stop going.
eventually, you're going to get rewarded in unimaginable ways, such that you would feel almost guilty for it.

i feel like a lot of people are waiting for luck to come to them, but it's the other way around.

luck is a byproduct of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. it is not something that can be obtained by chance alone.

most of the times, you know you *created your luck* when you're receiving _guerdons_ so easily compared to your peers, that it feels like you're cheating in some way.

moral of the story is **to create your own luck**.
