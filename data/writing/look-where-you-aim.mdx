I think that one of the most overlooked yet crucial principles for achieving success is the concept of unwavering visual focus *only* at what you want to attain. Seems logical right? Well, its consistent application is remarkably rare among individuals.

Consider for a moment, the fundamental necessity of having a clear, scoped destination -- a goal. The mere act of establishing such an objective already distinguishes you in the top quintile of people. However, the true differentiator relies in the fact that you have to block out / metaphorically cognitively screening out all the negative influences, and all the paths that will move you only further away from your goal. Essentially you need to have a tunnel vision towards it.

A great analogy for this principle can be found whilst driving a car. Experienced drivers instinctively understand the importance of **visual anticipation**. The skill of cornering -- fixing the gaze on the desired exit point of a turn rather than on an immediate object -- aka. "look-ahead steering", is a fundamental part of driving.

Novice drivers, on the other hand, often make the mistake of focusing counterintuitively on potential obstacles - in order to avoid them - paradoxically increasing the chance of an accident. This phenomenon is referred to as "target fixation" - shows off the importance of visual focus.

By consciously directing our attention towards our objectives and filtering out distractions, we can guarantee success.
