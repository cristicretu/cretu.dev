## Context

A button is one of the most complex pieces of a particular design system. When checking out a new library, the button is the first component I look after.
It can immediately tell me the quality, depth, and customization of the whole ecosystem.

If all of your buttons look like this:

```html showLineNumbers title="Basic button"
<button>Click me</button>
```

then we have a lot of work to do.

### Thinking big

This guide is aimed at large-scale design systems but can be adapted for your side-projects or demos. I will try to cover all of the important aspects of a **good** button.

### Starting off

You _should_ use the native `<button>` element. You can find all its attributes [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attributes).

### Size

All buttons should have two or three different sizes - do this with [scalable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scalable) sizes.

#### Usage:

Don't use a `<div>` or something else as a button. Stick to the `button` tag

```jsx showLineNumbers title="Native button"
<button size='small'>...</button>
```

### Hover state

This indicates that a button is clickable and interactive when hovered with the mouse.
**It's good practice that on mobile it _should not_ have any hover state.**
Use media queries like this to make sure you can use the hover state:

```css showLineNumbers title="button.css"
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  button:hover {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

### Focus state

This important feature indicates that the focus is on the button. Add your own `outline` or leave the default one - but _never_ remove it completely: `outline: 0`!

### Shape

Maybe you want just an icon or an avatar button. Either way, this is made possible with a `shape` prop. What this does is set the border radius of the button. Again three or four variants would be good, i.e small, medium, large, full.

```jsx showLineNumbers title="button.tsx"
<button shape='medium'>...</button>
```

### Icons

Indicating external links, or action type - icons assure a better understanding of the button.
You should have two props `suffix` and `prefix` showing the position of the icon.
They could be passed as svgs or better as JSX.Elements.
Padding should be dynamically scaled depending on the variant of the button, and the size of the text.

```jsx showLineNumbers title="button.tsx"
<button prefix={<LeftArrow />} suffix={<RightArrow />}>
  ...
</button>
```

### Variant

Implement as many variants as you want, but make sure to create as little styling as you can - to abstract the component when put together with other props.
Some examples:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/design/button#variant-shadow)
- [MUI](https://mui.com/components/buttons/#basic-button)

### Disabled

Indicate that the button is disabled.
You can also use a tooltip, or a `cursor: not-allowed;`

### Loading

Show that the action is asynchronous and is waiting for a response. A spinner is the most common way of indicating this.

### Succes Criterion

According to [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#target-size): buttons should have at least 44 by 44px so make sure you achieve that to assure accessibility on mobile.

## Full-fledged button example

_~Implement your styles..._

Interface with props:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="button.tsx"
interface Props {
  variant?: ButtonTypes
  loading?: boolean
  shadow?: boolean
  autoFocus?: boolean
  disabled?: boolean
  htmlType: React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<any>['type']
  suffix?: React.ReactNode
  prefix?: React.ReactNode
  onClick?: React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement>
  className?: string
  href?: string
}

const defaultProps {
  variant: 'contained' as ButtonTypes,
  loading: false.
  shadow: false,
  autoFocus: false,
  disabled: false,
  htmlType: 'button' as React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<any>['type'],
  className: ''
}

type NativeProps = Omit<React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<any>, keyof Props>
export type ButtonProps = Props & NativeProps
```

Button Component:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="button.tsx"
const ButtonComponent = React.forwardRef<
	  HTMLButtonElement,
	  React.PropsWithChildren<ButtonProps>
>(
  (btnProps: ButtonProps & typeof defaultProps, ref:
  React.ref<HTMLButtonElement | null>)
  ) => {
	// ...custom logic and destructuring here...

	return (
		<Button
			as={htmlType}
			ref={buttonRef}
			type={htmlType}
			className={className}
			disabled={disabled}
			onClick={handleClick}
		>
		{loading && <Spinner/>}
		{!!prefix && <span className={styles.prefix[size]}>{prefix}</span>}
		{children}
		{!!suffix && <span className={styles.suffix[size]}>{suffix}</span>}
		</Button>
	)
  }
)
```

Styles example, custom logic or variants (depending on your library of choice) are marked with `{}`:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="button.tsx"
const Button = styled('button', {
	box-sizing: 'border-box',
	display: 'inline-block',
	border-radius: {radius},
	line-height: {SCALES.height(2.5)},
	font-weight: {weight},
	font-size: {SCALES.font(0.75)},
	justify-content: 'center',
	white-space: 'nowrap',
	text-align: 'center',
	transition: 'background-color 200ms ease 0ms, box-shadow 200ms ease 0ms, border 200ms ease 0ms, color 200ms ease 0ms',
	position: 'relative',
	overflow: 'hidden',
	color: {color},
	background-color: {bg},
	cursor: {cursor},
	pointer-events: {events},
	border: `1px solid ${border}`,
	width: {auto ? 'auto': 'initial'},
	height: {SCALES.height(2.5)},
	padding: {SCALES.pX(1)} {SCALES.py(0.5)},
	margin: {SCALED.m(0.25)}
	...
})
```

This is an almost-complete button component. Use your logic for destructuring props, passing refs, and more. Make use of compound variants for different UI libraries.

Hope this helped you! Go build cool buttons!
