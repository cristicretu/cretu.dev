## Intro

Reflecting on the past 365 days, it's clear that 2023 didn't follow the same growth trend as [2022](/writing/2022) and [2021](/writing/2021) - meaning that I think my progress stagnated a bit, instead of growing at the same rate as previous years.
Nevertheless, I learned a bunch of new cool stuff, and changed my perspective and mindset a lot, hopefully preparing for an awesome 2024?! 

## Summary

Starting the year, I didn't have a lot of time to fully commit to some full-project (due to having the final High-School exams at the end of June), so I did a bunch of small side projects:
 I created Figma design tutorials, [Bento Cards](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1633561109465579525), and [Apple AppKit](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1680609294109007875). 
Made a small game to [crack Arc Invite Codes](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1630509545272344576). Started learning SwiftUI (again), by building different projects, like [The Eyeballing Game](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1649813595302113281), where you have to guess different design games - inspired by [@raunofreiberg](https://twitter.com/raunofreiberg). I also made different interactions, [like this one](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1667972933069807620).

Took a small break from coding and desing in June, whilst I had the exams (which went good!) - and I got accepted into university. For the remaining of the year, I worked with the wonderful team at [Deta](https://deta.space) - building the future internet OS. I made a lot of prototypes, designs, and features - some of which you can see [here](/work/). 
We launched on the [**10th of October**](https://twitter.com/detahq/status/1711774041965552061), after almost two years of intense work (for me) and more than four years for the team. Was super proud of the team, and that a lot of people loved our product.
In the meantime, of course that I made more side projects, those one built during internal hackatons: [Stacks](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1681012757045428224) was launched, a tiny app where you can unveil your arsenal of tools. Build Hani - a minimal HN reader and Beacon - an app to view, build, and send invoices. Will launch those two soon `:)`.
All of my projects that I made this year are open source, so feel free to take a peek at the code [here](https://github.com/cristicretu).

In October I started university, taking linear algebra, assembly, and more. It's good so far, even though I think you can learn more by doing your own side projects. What I started doing, besides this is to learn about AI, specifically about deep learning. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iqn1HhFJ6c) - with Ilya Sutskever sparked something in me, that made me start learning about AI. Now I'm just learning and implementing different papers, learning about transformers and more.

## Advice

Here are some of my key learnings and takeaways from this year:

- What you cannot teach, you cannot understand.
- Have a beginners mind about what might work and what might not. Try new things, constantly. 
- Don't believe in shortcuts.
    - That's the only way someone else could get rich off of you.
    - Comes from desperation + ignorance .
- Always start from the problem, not the solution.
- There is always competition, always tell the best story.
- Pretend you only have 1hr/week to complete a task.
    - Actually believe this, and you'll move through things much faster.
- When in doubt, always return to the basics.
    - Think often about the midwit meme, the real masters are the ones that go simple.
- Write, and dump anything & everything you have in your brain on a piece of paper.
- Drink more water than you think you need.
- Go with the flow - you never know how today links to your future.
- It's important to pick work that aligns with your natural abilities and deep interests.
- Be confident in your abilities but remain humble. 
- Engaging in your own projects is crucial. These projects should be ambitiously exciting and drive your curiosity. Personal projects often lead to great work.
- Aim high but keep your expectations realistic. This balance helps maintain motivation and prevents burnout.

Since my growth took the shape of a [log function](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Riaz-Mian/publication/323265326/figure/fig1/AS:595762899591168@1519052352116/A-graph-of-the-common-logarithm-function-for-positive-real-numbers.png) this year, I want to take revenge next year, and correct it to be [exponential](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/69883a595f6de177e922ba131fae677fe453760d.svg) again. For this I'll be publishing how to accelerate in 2024, and few tips that I'll follow then.

Thanks for reading friends! Here to wish you a wonderful 2024 full of your wishes!
