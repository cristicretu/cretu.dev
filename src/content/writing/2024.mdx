## Intro

This year has truly been a year of the unexpected, but in a good way. I've planned a roughly different route than the one I took, but I'm glad that I've ended up where I am. Took some important decisions, and 
[asked a lot of whys](/writing/ask-why) - that ultimately shaped my long-time vision. Grateful for everything that happened, and looking forward to the next year.


## Summary

In the genesis of this year, I tried experimenting with SwiftUI, [again](https://x.com/cristicrtu/status/1747710392439025722) and built few prototypes. Really liking the flow and experience, and I will definitely continue working on it, starting next year.

Brushed off my competitive-programming side and proposed two problems for a local CP contest, [here](https://kilonova.ro/problems/2581) and [here](https://kilonova.ro/problems/2582).

Something that I'm proud about, and that also took a lot of time, was working on a maths book. Specifically a book for the Romanian high-school students, that want to get into the Babes-Bolyai University. We worked on this book for close to 7 months, and it's finally out. You can find it [here](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/wp-content/uploads/Probleme-si-Teste-Grila-de-Matematica-pt.-Admiterea-la-Facultatea-de-Matematica-si-Informatica-UBB-2025.pdf).
From proposing problems, to writing them in LaTeX, the solutions, verifying problems, to designing the cover, publishing it, and more - it was a long journey, but I'm glad that it's finally out.

Here's the cover design, made in Figma:

The biggest side-project that I worked on this year, was a (unreleased) Chrome extension, that I built for my own use -- it's an extension that filters specific elements from a page, selected by the user, (like a CSS selector), and then uses a local LLM to decide what to do with them.


Starting from April, we started prototyping something new, at Deta, lots of Figma concepts, and tldraws later, this became [Deta Surf](https://deta.surf). Spent the summer in Berlin, which was a really wonderful experience. Moving out of my comfort zone, known-zone was very beneficial and it has really opened my eyes to a lot of things.
We've released a bunch of updates and new features, and in early December we've reached v0.1.0.

The mindset shift that I've made this year, was to focus on the long-term vision, and not the short-term. The key components of life in general are (stolen from [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval)):

- Fit body
- Calm mind
- House full of love
- Wealth

Doing this separation not only makes sense, but also helps you focus on the right things. You can categorize almost anything into those 4 things.

## Advice

Here are some of my key learnings and takeaways from this year:

- NEVER speak negatively about yourself, not even as a joke.
- Who you are today is a set of programs: what your parents taught you, institutions you were in, relationships you were exposed to, etc.
  - If you don't like your current self, change the programs.
- Every great idea is first just imagined. Visualize it, and then make it happen.
  - Kobe believed that every shot he took was going in.
- Before you start anything, read the map, or create your own.
  - The map you create is often better than the one you follow.
- The best growth comes from explaining complex things simply.
- Make things that solve your own problems first.
- Knowledge compounds faster than money.
- Learn to go into a default state of calmness - know what you can control, and what you cannot.
- Create more than you consume.
- Change your inputs to change your outputs.
- Diverge into more topics, thus becoming interdisciplinary.
- The best way to predict the future is to invent it.

For the past years, I've been doing an interesting experiment - reviewing the next year instead of the past one. Each December, I write a review of the upcoming year (2025 in 2024), then revisit it 12 months later. What's fascinating is that around 80% of these "predictions" manifest into reality.

The key is to write these future reviews in a calm, honest state of mind. It's not about wishful thinking, but rather a deep visualization exercise where you project your genuine trajectory. This approach combines mindful visualization with realistic self-assessment, turning abstract goals into likely outcomes. The high accuracy rate suggests that our subconscious often knows our path before we consciously realize it - we just need to listen carefully.

Thanks for sticking with me this year, 2025 is going to be the best year of our lives. Trust me on this one.
