2025 hit different. 

2.6x more shipped than 2024. Measured by commits, projects launched, and hours logged. Checked my "2025 predictions" from last December - 80% hit, some overshot. Writing down what you want actually works.


# What happened

Started the year with the usual exams. Boring.

**January** - [palora](https://x.com/cristicrtu/status/1895894208994775290). First SwiftUI app. Realtime color extraction from camera feed. Nothing crazy, but I wanted to learn the platform and I did.

**February** - Published our second book: Probleme si Teste Grila de Informatica for Romanian high schoolers prepping for UBB admission. Physical product, actual distribution, people using it to get into university.

**February** - [Optima](https://x.com/cristicrtu/status/1916344345761253450). AI that roasts your workouts. My first real 0→1 product. Made some tiktoks with zero experience, got ~1k views total, converted 7 actual users.

Then it died.

Here's what I learned: the code took a weekend. The App Store Connect bullshit, the icons, the screenshots, the metadata - that took longer. And marketing? Marketing is a full-time job pretending to be a side task. Those 7 users taught me more than any tutorial. I talked to them. I watched how they used it. That's the game.

**May** - Max and Aavash from Deta came to Romania for a few days. Always good to hang with the team IRL.

**June** - Joined [clujhouse](https://x.com/clujhouse) after meeting [Andrew](https://x.com/andreidro) earlier in the year. Started at Anara shortly after. Six months in, feels like two years. We ship fast, I actually use the product daily, and I've been polishing UI and pushing features since day one. 2026 is going to be bigger.

**August** - Traveled to the US for the first time - San Francisco. Reading my 2024 review I realized I actually wrote this down as a goal and forgot about it. Somehow predicted it. SF is a different world. If you want to build something, that's the place. Even just being there and absorbing the culture gets you further than you'd expect. 

**December** - Made [hive](https://x.com/cristicrtu/status/1995163349949259809), a small open source CLI for running N agents on N tasks in parallel without them shooting each other in the foot. Still a work in progress but the core idea works. 

**December** started [vinculum](https://x.com/cristicrtu/status/2003502564013408524)

I've tried to build this three times before and failed. The idea: education doesn't scale because good teaching is 1:1 and we've been stuck with 1:30 classrooms for centuries. LLMs change that equation. One tutor per student, infinitely patient, available always.

Super early. If you want to try it, reach out. Launch planned for 2026.

# The numbers 


| Activity           | Time                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Mac Screen Time    | 8:38hr on average [3,151 hours in total]   |
| iPhone Screen Time | 0:52hr on average [316 hours in total]     |
| University         | 2hr on average [280 hours in total]        |
| Driving            | 240 hours [12,431km]                       |
| Gaming             | 200 hours [Battlefield 6 or Arma Reforger] |
| Gym                | 1hr on average [163 hours in total]        |

I track most of this passively. Screen Time, Apple Health, apps with year-end wrapped features. If you're not measuring you're guessing.

# What Actually Stuck

On building:

- Ship first, optimize never (or later). The best architecture with zero users is worthless.
- Do the simplest thing that could possibly work. You can always add complexity. You can't always subtract it.
- Research is procrastination wearing a lab coat. Build something, watch it break, fix it.

On marketing:

- It's not a side quest. It's the main quest. Code is the easy part.
- Nobody is posting. Everyone is consuming. The bar for standing out is low if you just show up consistently.

On learning:

- The smartest people are self-taught even if they went to school. Credentials get you in the door. Skill keeps you in the room.
- You can learn anything. The "too late" thing is a cope.

On mindset:

- Your plan is always smaller than what's possible. Most limitations are self-imposed.
- You get what you believe you deserve. Sounds like woo but watch how you negotiate, how you price yourself, how you ask for things. It's there.
- The cold water doesn't get warmer if you jump late.
- Everyone is figuring it out as they go. The people who look like they know? Better actors.


Thanks for sticking with me this year. You the real one.

## 2026

This year is going to skyrocket. 

More vinculum. More shipping. Less overthinking.

10x the output. 1000x the results. 

See you next year.
