I changed my perspective about life and people in general while achieving most of my wishes.\n\nThis post wouldn't have been possible without the awesome people from Twitter: \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jsngr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@jsngr\u003C/a>,\n\u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/julianlehr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@julianlehr\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/peduarte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@peduarte\u003C/a>,\n\u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/brian_lovin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@brian_lovin\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/pacocoursey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@pacocoursey\u003C/a>,\n\u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/emilkowalski_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@emilkowalski_\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/raunofreiberg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@raunofreiberg\u003C/a>,\n\u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/leerob\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@leerob\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ancashoria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@ancashoria\u003C/a> - from which I learned a fair ammount of programming and took a lot of\ninspiration.\n\n## Year summary\n\nKnowing nothing about web development, I have started learning the basic steps. I liked the fact that I could combine my design skills\nwith programming. For about three months, I made mostly basic websites for various purposes. Until March I focused a lot on\nolympiads: competitive programming and mathematics - in which I qualified at the national stage and progressed a lot.\n\nFollowing that period, I tried ReactJs for the first time and was fascinated by its powers. Tutorial after tutorial, documentation after documentation,\nI liked the dynamic approach and the development experience. In April I accomplished one of my old dreams: getting a MacBook. Saving money for some time and Apple releasing the M1 Chip\ncouldn't have been timed better. I'm grateful for it - it surely made my life a lot easier.\n\nChanging the focus once again, I worked for about two months on our robot for the [First Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) Competition. A lot of research, prototyping,\nCAD designing and engineering were made alongside my team. Unfortunately, we didn't qualify for the next stage due to a robot component breaking a few days before the\nstart of the contest. Contrary to that, I won the [Dean's List](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/deans-list) Award, selected from over 300 students from Romania - in recognition of leadership and dedication for leading the team to increase awareness for First and for achieving personal technical expertise and accomplishment.\n\nThinking that I need to level up the programming skills I took Harvard's CS50. I still believe that this is the best course ever made, as it helped me a lot to reach my desired level.\nMade my first internet money. Started prototyping in SwiftUI for some time, then came back to React, as it had a flatter learning curve. Multiple side projects later,\nI transitioned to the back-end using Ben Awad's [dream stack](https://twitter.com/benawad/status/1199337684734377991?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1199337684734377991%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.benawad.com%2Fwhat-is-the-best-graphql-stack-for-nodejs%2F).\nCreated some prototypes and planning to release a product next year.\n\nLater that autumn I got hired by a good friend of mine to work on multiple projects. That marked exactly 11 months after I started to learn web development.\nTowards the end of the year, I have experimented with interfaces, design systems, and flexible components.\n\n## Media consumption\n\n| Activity           | Time                                    |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |\n| Sleep              | 8:09 on average [2.987 hours in total]  |\n| Mac Screen Time    | 6:11 on average [2.257 hours in total]  |\n| School             | 5 hours on average [840 hours in total] |\n| Music              | 573 hours / 866 artists                 |\n| iPhone Screen Time | 1:34 on average [571 hours in total]    |\n| Youtube            | 307 hours                               |\n| Reading            | 221 hours (37 books, publications)      |\n| Steam              | 46 hours                                |\n| Cycling            | 36 hours [512 km]                       |\n| Chess              | 21 hours                                |\n\nFor anyone wondering, this statistic was made using some spreadsheets combined with Apple's buggy Screen Time and Strava.\n\n## Advice\n\nI always thought that by helping others, you help yourself, so here are some of my takeaways from this year, including personal experience, books, and more:\n\n- Always work in Pomodoro sessions. Long studying sessions mean that you'll only remember the first 20 minutes and the last 20, and in between that you'll lose all the information.\n- To cut the learning curve, teach.\n- Ask questions. Ask the right questions.\n- Knowledge is not power. Knowledge times action is power.\n- Transform the FOMO into JOMO (Joy of missing out).\n- A clean environment is the best place to study.\n- Nothing is original.\n- You're only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with.\n- It's always your job to get yourself an education.\n- Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver.\n- Sharpen the saw before you do anything else.\n- Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person.\n- Begin with the end in mind.\n- Don't break the chain. We work because it's a chain reaction, each subject leads to the next. Use the end of one project to light up the next one.\n- Creativity is not a talent. It's a way of operating.\n- Work is never finished, only abandoned.\n- Be kind.\n- **Go make that stuff.**\n\nThanks for reading. I hope 2022 is going to be a great year for everyone.

Most of my wishes, if not all of them,\nhave been accomplished!! The grind and hard work have been intense, but the rewards and lessons learned are priceless. So, here's a quick\nrecap of what happened:\n\nStarting the year, I worked at \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Landmarks-Tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landmarks\u003C/a> for four months, where\nI was able to significantly improve my front-end skills and gained valuable experience collaborating on a team project.

In my spare time, I also prepared a lot and got my driving license. Toward the end of the year, I ended up purchasing my very own car.\n\nNow over to my favorite section ─ **les statistiques ✨**.\n\n## Media consumption\n\n| Activity           | Time

Here are some of the best recommendations I accumulated:\n\n- If you can't decide, the answer is no\n- Take the path more painful in the short term\n- To think clearly, and understand the basics. Don't memorize\n- Happiness is about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things\n- \"A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things outside of their control\"\n- Put yourself and your work out there every day\n- When changing/implementing a new habit, you also have to change your identity based on it\n  - You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you'll continue to be pulled towards spending rather than earning \n- Design your environment for success\n- Be confident, those that are winning, only feel more confident after a win, and those who lose are weak\n- **Be friends with people who want the best for you**\n- Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today\n- The successful people sacrifice.\n- Leave your phone on do not disturb all-day\n- Spend more time with people who give you energy\n- There is no such thing as failure, only failure to learn\n- Don't take things for granted. Say 'wow' and be grateful. \n- **The best investment you can make is to invest in yourself**\n\nThis was what I wanted to share about this amazing year - thanks for reading! I hope 2023 will only offer prosperity while everyone will  improve considerably.","src/content/writing/2022.mdx","1bb3e49c34bba568","2022.mdx","2023",{"id":34,"data":36,"body":41,"filePath":42,"digest":43,"legacyId":44,"deferredRender":22},{"title":37,"publishedAt":38,"summary":39,"image":40},"Revisiting 2023","2023-12-24","A recap of a long year.","/static/images/2023/2023.png","## Intro\n\nReflecting on the past 365 days, it's clear that 2023 didn't follow the same growth trend as [2022](/writing/2022) and [2021](/writing/2021) - meaning that I think my progress stagnated a bit, instead of growing at the same rate as previous years.\nNevertheless, I learned a bunch of new cool stuff, and changed my perspective and mindset a lot, hopefully preparing for an awesome 2024?! \n\n## Summary\n\nStarting the year, I didn't have a lot of time to fully commit to some full-project (due to having the final High-School exams at the end of June), so I did a bunch of small side projects:\n I created Figma design tutorials, [Bento Cards](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1633561109465579525), and [Apple AppKit](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1680609294109007875). \nMade a small game to [crack Arc Invite Codes](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1630509545272344576). Started learning SwiftUI (again), by building different projects, like [The Eyeballing Game](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1649813595302113281), where you have to guess different design games - inspired by [@raunofreiberg](https://twitter.com/raunofreiberg). I also made different interactions, [like this one](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1667972933069807620).\n\nTook a small break from coding and desing in June, whilst I had the exams (which went good!) - and I got accepted into university. For the remaining of the year, I worked with the wonderful team at [Deta](https://deta.space) - building the future internet OS. I made a lot of prototypes, designs, and features - some of which you can see [here](/work/). \nWe launched on the [**10th of October**](https://twitter.com/detahq/status/1711774041965552061), after almost two years of intense work (for me) and more than four years for the team. Was super proud of the team, and that a lot of people loved our product.\nIn the meantime, of course that I made more side projects, those one built during internal hackatons: [Stacks](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1681012757045428224) was launched, a tiny app where you can unveil your arsenal of tools. Build Hani - a minimal HN reader and Beacon - an app to view, build, and send invoices. Will launch those two soon `:)`.\nAll of my projects that I made this year are open source, so feel free to take a peek at the code [here](https://github.com/cristicretu).\n\nIn October I started university, taking linear algebra, assembly, and more. It's good so far, even though I think you can learn more by doing your own side projects. What I started doing, besides this is to learn about AI, specifically about deep learning. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iqn1HhFJ6c) - with Ilya Sutskever sparked something in me, that made me start learning about AI. Now I'm just learning and implementing different papers, learning about transformers and more.\n\n\n## Media consumption\n\n| Activity           | Time                                     |\n|

you cannot understand.\n- Have a beginners mind about what might work and what might not. Try new things, constantly. \n- Don't believe in shortcuts.\n    - That's the only way someone else could get rich off of you.\n    - Comes from desperation + ignorance .\n- Always start from the problem, not the solution.\n- There is always competition, always tell the best story.\n- Pretend you only have 1hr/week to complete a task.\n    - Actually believe this, and you'll move through things much faster.\n- When in doubt, always return to the basics.\n    - Think often about the midwit meme, the real masters are the ones that go simple.\n- Write, and dump anything & everything you have in your brain on a piece of paper.\n- Drink more water than you think you need.\n- Go with the flow - you never know how today links to your future.\n- It's important to pick work that aligns with your natural abilities and deep interests.\n- Be confident in your abilities but remain humble. \n- Engaging in your own projects is crucial. These projects should be ambitiously exciting and drive your curiosity. Personal projects often lead to great work.\n- Aim high but keep your expectations realistic. This balance helps maintain motivation and prevents burnout.\n\nSince my growth took the shape of a [log function](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Riaz-Mian/publication/323265326/figure/fig1/AS:595762899591168@1519052352116/A-graph-of-the-common-logarithm-function-for-positive-real-numbers.png) this year, I want to take revenge next year, and correct it to be [exponential](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/69883a595f6de177e922ba131fae677fe453760d.svg) again. For this I'll be publishing how to accelerate in 2024, and few tips that I'll follow then.\n\nThanks for reading friends!

To achieve this, focus on four key areas of your life:\n\n- Mind\n- Body\n- Spirit\n- Financial\n\n### Mind\n\nTo cultivate mental growth and resilience, aim to master your mind through disciplined actions, meditation, and a strong mind-body connection.\n\n1. **Challenge Your Brain** by learning something new every day, whether it's a fact, skill, or a hobby. If you don't like something, outgrow the mind and do it, leave the comfort zone. (You don't need to change radically, but start with small steps).\n   \n2. **Read Regularly**, this is the gym-equivalent for the brain. Start with topics you enjoy and gradually expand your interests.\n   \n3. **Become a better problem solver.** Life is a series of problems to solve. Expose yourself to various challenges and increase their complexity over time. This approach is well-known in mathematics and other analytical fields.\n\nStealing a quote from **Karpathy**:\n\n> the general point is that you have to recognize that you are dumb, accept it, come to terms with it, and forgive yourself. only then can you trick yourself into becoming smarter.\n   \n4. Also, try to **limit screen time**, or put a noise filter on at all times. This means to get rid off news, social media completely. It just adds unnecessary mental chatter, your mind should focus on what's on your life. Our minds are over-stimulated, so we need to calm them down a bit. Here's, again, another quote from Karpathy:\n\n    > Returning from an experimental ~2 week detox from the internet. Main takeaway is that I didn't realize how unsettled the mind can get when over-stimulating on problems/information (like a stirred liquid), and ~2 weeks is enough to settle into a lot more zen state.\n\n5. **Practice meditation** every day. This enhances focus, reduces stress, and improve overall mental well-being.\n\n6. **Allocate time for deep**, focused work without interruptions. This state of concentration leads to higher productivity and better outcomes.\n\n### Body\n\nWithout body health, nothing from this list matters. No one wants to do anything when he's sick, right?\n\nSolution is to take a precaution, and stay in shape, *bare minimum*.\n\nThen, be very objective, if you can't ask a friend, if he's not objective, ask a random stranger: **what are my shortcomings?** Focus on those. In my case I was underweight by a lot and thought that *\"that's how my metabolism is\"*, which is, in fact, true - but that does not mean that you cannot do anything against that. Go on a calorie surplus, do weight lifting or calisthenics and you're good. You can do your own scenario depending on your situation. Reality is that nobody is perfect, but we can tend asymptotically towards greatness.\n\n1. Put a goal depending on your state, and show up daily\n  - no matter how big / small it is, if you **really** put your mind power that you build before into this, you're going to achieve it 100%\n\t- **train hard**\n   \n2. **Daily Sunlight and Steps:** Get sunlight daily and aim for at least 6,000 steps each day.\n   \n3. Maintain good hygiene and address any physical imperfections like acne or asymmetry.\n   - naturally, we're attracted to beautiful people because it's a sign of great health, and personal respect\n\t- again, see any shortcomings, and try to fix them (facial asymmetry, acne, etc.)\n   \n4. **Healthy Diet:** Eliminate toxic snacks and fast food. Opt for fresh, whole foods. Prioritize fruits, vegetables, and high-quality meats.\n   \n5. **Sleep** is maybe one of the most important factors, and I could include it to all categories.\n  \n    - sleep for 7:30h, or 9hr (bc. 90min cycles)\n\t- wake up, and go to sleep at the same time each day, no matter the day\n\t- sleep in a colder environment\n\t- before sleep (T-1 hours) remove phone completely, and instead read a book, and before meditate, you'll sleep like a baby\n\t- don't eat T-3 hours before bed\n   \n6. **Stay Hydrated:** Drink 2.5-3 liters of water daily.\n\n#### Spirit\n\nThis could be different from person to person, but at least try to be *grateful for anything that you have*. You could always give a contra-example of what you have, so remember to be happy and aknowledge that you're priviliged in any way (small or very big).\n\nTry to keep a positive attitiude, and filter out bad stuff around you, it is only going to hurt your mind. \n\nPray, if you want to be ordinary, it's ok to just stay as you are, but if you want to be extra-ordinary, you need an anchor, and a guiding hand for you to go forward. (quote adapted from Steve Harvey).\n\nI would put social connections to the spirit section as well, because we, at the end of the day are social creatures, and socializing fuels our internal spirit. \nEach person has a different configuration for the social-o-meter, but try to not be surrounded by 4 walls all week, and instead see some friends, maybe message some old colleagues and catch up. Opposingly, try to also have some alone time, in your own thoughts, and not be surrounded by other people all the time. Quote from Naval:\n\n>All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.\n\n### Financial\n\nAnyone who says that money does not buy happiness is. A liar.\nMoney, alone, does indeed not bring happiness, but it brings stability, well-being, and with well thought decisions, you're \"set for life\".\n\nThe gist of it is that in order to also be fulfilled, and to create some kind of dent in the world, you need to solve some real problems. This is the BSC of entrepreneurship. Try to solve a problem (ideally that a lot of people, including you, have), and try to scale the solution as big as you can.\n\nIf you're working in a 9-5, pick a company that does a dent in the world. Don't work for huge companies, with internal structures similar to binary trees of more than 10 levels, that build let's say a worse Gmail. Pick a company with a vision that excites you, where you also learn from cracked engineers / people, and form good friendships. \n\nIf you're working solo, look out for problems in your daily life, start small and expand on the validated solution. More into this you can find from people like [Levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio).\n\n\n## Ending words\n\nThis was just the tip of the iceberg; you could explore depth-wise all of those ideas much, much further, but that's left to the reader.\n\nThis was just an overview to what I've already implemented in 2022, left some in 2023, and then combined all back into 2024, which has been a wonderful year so far.\n\nLock in.","src/content/writing/accelerating.mdx","078a993553e83279","accelerating.mdx","agi",{"id":56,"data":58,"body":63,"filePath":64,"digest":65,"legacyId":66,"deferredRender":22},{"title":59,"publishedAt":60,"summary":61,"image":62},"The future of the World","2023-11-23","My view on how AI will complement humans.","/static/images/agi/ai.png","We're at a very interesting time on Earth. The probability that AGI is going to happen soon is high enough that you should take it seriously.\nRight now, this is just something that many people have not realised yet (including myself from some weeks prior to this) - the speed of computers of AI is going to increase by a lot in a very short amount of time [^1].\n\nIn the last year, we've seen how LLM's (Large Language Models) are basically everywhere: from helping you with debugging some bug, or suggesting some diet / meal plan, to reflecting on your notes. You see tools like [v0](https://v0.dev/), where now it can generate consistent and clean UI's, or [Deta's Create an App with AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVda_V-DpQ8) - going from idea to working app in mere minutes.\n\nLearning any new topic is enhanced deeply by those tools as well - any time I try to grasp or better comprehend any new topic, I see myself getting back to GPT for summaries, or better explanations / rephrasing.\n\n> Over the last couple of months, it's gotten only better and better, and it's hard to realise the speed of growth.\n\nUnfortunately, a percentage of people that realised this growth, are trying to stop it, or slow it down.\n\t\nA lot of people are pushing for EA (Effective Altruism), or trying to decelerate the growth, or regulate AI. I feel that this is only a delay, or even a killing of possibly the greatest achievement of our generation (or the whole species). \n\nInstead, if we all could grind and share the knowledge to go faster and further together we could achieve great things [^2] - e/acc (Effective Accelerationism).  \n\nImagine if we're now at step 1. of GPT - where it's basically just imitating humans [^3] - how it could be even more useful (talking 100x), when we get to step 2. where it gets better and better by self improving (see AlphaGo and how it had no human intervention and was not using any historical data [^4]).\n\nIt's important that when we reach the point of AGI, it's not something fixed in a hands of a few powerful people [^5], but rather somehow built as a cooperation between multiple countries, or even down to individuals. \n\nAs AI rapidly evolves, our focus should be on collaborative achievements rather than restrictive regulation - ensuring the democratization of this technology for the benefit of all humanity. This pivotal moment invites us to envision a future where AGI exponentially increases human potential through shared global effort.\n\n[^1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iqn1HhFJ6c\n[^2]: https://x.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1727770171136246079\n[^3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g\n[^4]: https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphago/\n[^5]: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p24mdl7f_dI","src/content/writing/agi.mdx","16efb12c255591e1","agi.mdx","2024",{"id":67,"data":69,"body":74,"filePath":75,"digest":76,"legacyId":77,"deferredRender":22},{"title":70,"publishedAt":71,"summary":72,"image":73},"Peeking into 2024","2024-12-24","A look into the year that marked my growth.","/static/images/2024/2024.png","## Intro\n\nThis year has truly been a year of the unexpected, but in a good way. I've planned a roughly different route than the one I took, but I'm glad that I've ended up where I am. Took some important decisions, and \n[asked a lot of whys](/writing/ask-why) - that ultimately shaped my long-time vision. Grateful for everything that happened, and looking forward to the next year.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the genesis of this year, I tried experimenting with SwiftUI, [again](https://x.com/cristicrtu/status/1747710392439025722) and built few prototypes. Really liking the flow and experience, and I will definitely continue working on it, starting next year.\n\nBrushed off my competitive-programming side and proposed two problems for a local CP contest, [here](https://kilonova.ro/problems/2581) and [here](https://kilonova.ro/problems/2582).\n\nSomething that I'm proud about, and that also took a lot of time, was working on a maths book. Specifically a book for the Romanian high-school students, that want to get into the Babes-Bolyai University. We worked on this book for close to 7 months, and it's finally out. You can find it [here](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/wp-content/uploads/Probleme-si-Teste-Grila-de-Matematica-pt.-Admiterea-la-Facultatea-de-Matematica-si-Informatica-UBB-2025.pdf).\nFrom proposing problems, to writing them in LaTeX, the solutions, verifying problems, to designing the cover, publishing it, and more - it was a long journey, but I'm glad that it's finally out.\n\nHere's the cover design, made in Figma:\n\n![Cover design](/static/images/2024/book.jpeg)\n\n\nThe biggest side-project that I worked on this year, was a (unreleased) Chrome extension, that I built for my own use -- it's an extension that filters specific elements from a page, selected by the user, (like a CSS selector), and then uses a local LLM to decide what to do with them.\n\n\nStarting from April, we started prototyping something new, at Deta, lots of Figma concepts, and tldraws later, this became [Deta Surf](https://deta.surf). Spent the summer in Berlin, which was a really wonderful experience. Moving out of my comfort zone, known-zone was very beneficial and it has really opened my eyes to a lot of things.\nWe've released a bunch of updates and new features, and in early December we've reached v0.1.0.\n\nThe mindset shift that I've made this year, was to focus on the long-term vision, and not the short-term. The key components of life in general are (stolen from [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval)):\n\n- Fit body\n- Calm mind\n- House full of love\n- Wealth\n\nDoing this separation not only makes sense, but also helps you focus on the right things. You can categorize almost anything into those 4 things.\n\n## Media consumption\n\n| Activity           | Time                                     |\n| ------------------ |

of programs: what your parents taught you, institutions you were in, relationships you were exposed to, etc.\n  - If you don't like your current self, change the programs.\n- Every great idea is first just imagined. Visualize it, and then make it happen.\n  - Kobe believed that every shot he took was going in.\n- Before you start anything, read the map, or create your own.\n  - The map you create is often better than the one you follow.\n- The best growth comes from explaining complex things simply.\n- Make things that solve your own problems first.\n- Knowledge compounds faster than money.\n- Learn to go into a default state of calmness - know what you can control, and what you cannot.\n- Create more than you consume.\n- Change your inputs to change your outputs.\n- Diverge into more topics, thus becoming interdisciplinary.\n- The best way to predict the future is to invent it.\n\nFor the past years, I've been doing an interesting experiment - reviewing the next year instead of the past one. Each December, I write a review of the upcoming year (2025 in 2024), then revisit it 12 months later. What's fascinating is that around 80% of these \"predictions\" manifest into reality.\n\nThe key is to write these future reviews in a calm, honest state of mind. It's not about wishful thinking, but rather a deep visualization exercise where you project your genuine trajectory. This approach combines mindful visualization with realistic self-assessment, turning abstract goals into likely outcomes. The high accuracy rate suggests that our subconscious often knows our path before we consciously realize it - we just need to listen carefully.\n\nThanks for sticking with me this year, 2025 is going to be the best year of our lives.

When checking out a new library, the button is the first component I look after.\nIt can immediately tell me the quality, depth, and customization of the whole ecosystem.\n\nIf all of your buttons look like this:\n\n```html showLineNumbers title=\"Basic button\"\n\u003Cbutton>Click me\u003C/button>\n```\n\nthen we have a lot of work to do.\n\n### Thinking big\n\nThis guide is aimed at large-scale design systems but can be adapted for your side-projects or demos. I will try to cover all of the important aspects of a **good** button.\n\n### Starting off\n\nYou _should_ use the native `\u003Cbutton>` element. You can find all its attributes [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attributes).\n\n### Size\n\nAll buttons should have two or three different sizes - do this with [scalable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scalable) sizes.\n\n#### Usage:\n\nDon't use a `\u003Cdiv>` or something else as a button. Stick to the `button` tag\n\n```jsx showLineNumbers title=\"Native button\"\n\u003Cbutton size='small'>...\u003C/button>\n```\n\n### Hover state\n\nThis indicates that a button is clickable and interactive when hovered with the mouse.\n**It's good practice that on mobile it _should not_ have any hover state.**\nUse media queries like this to make sure you can use the hover state:\n\n```css showLineNumbers title=\"button.css\"\n@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {\n  button:hover {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Focus state\n\nThis important feature indicates that the focus is on the button. Add your own `outline` or leave the default one - but _never_ remove it completely: `outline: 0`!\n\n### Shape\n\nMaybe you want just an icon or an avatar button. Either way, this is made possible with a `shape` prop. What this does is set the border radius of the button. Again three or four variants would be good, i.e small, medium, large, full.\n\n```jsx showLineNumbers title=\"button.tsx\"\n\u003Cbutton shape='medium'>...\u003C/button>\n```\n\n### Icons\n\nIndicating external links, or action type - icons assure a better understanding of the button.\nYou should have two props `suffix` and `prefix` showing the position of the icon.\nThey could be passed as svgs or better as JSX.Elements.\nPadding should be dynamically scaled depending on the variant of the button, and the size of the text.\n\n```jsx showLineNumbers title=\"button.tsx\"\n\u003Cbutton prefix={\u003CLeftArrow />} suffix={\u003CRightArrow />}>\n  ...\n\u003C/button>\n```\n\n### Variant\n\nImplement as many variants as you want, but make sure to create as little styling as you can - to abstract the component when put together with other props.\nSome examples:\n\n- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/design/button#variant-shadow)\n- [MUI](https://mui.com/components/buttons/#basic-button)\n\n### Disabled\n\nIndicate that the button is disabled.\nYou can also use a tooltip, or a `cursor: not-allowed;`\n\n### Loading\n\nShow that the action is asynchronous and is waiting for a response. A spinner is the most common way of indicating this.\n\n### Succes Criterion\n\nAccording to [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#target-size): buttons should have at least 44 by 44px so make sure you achieve that to assure accessibility on mobile.\n\nRead more here:\n\n- [Button](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#button)\n- [Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#keyboard-interaction-3)\n- [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#wai-aria-roles-states-and-properties-3)\n\n## Full-fledged button example\n\n_~Implement your styles..._\n\nInterface with props:\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers title=\"button.tsx\"\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: ButtonTypes\n  loading?: boolean\n  shadow?: boolean\n  autoFocus?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n  htmlType: React.ButtonHTMLAttributes\u003Cany>['type']\n  suffix?: React.ReactNode\n  prefix?: React.ReactNode\n  onClick?: React.MouseEventHandler\u003CHTMLButtonElement>\n  className?: string\n  href?: string\n}\n\nconst defaultProps {\n  variant: 'contained' as ButtonTypes,\n  loading: false.\n  shadow: false,\n  autoFocus: false,\n  disabled: false,\n  htmlType: 'button' as React.ButtonHTMLAttributes\u003Cany>['type'],\n  className: ''\n}\n\ntype NativeProps = Omit\u003CReact.ButtonHTMLAttributes\u003Cany>, keyof Props>\nexport type ButtonProps = Props & NativeProps\n```\n\nButton Component:\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers title=\"button.tsx\"\nconst ButtonComponent = React.forwardRef\u003C\n\t  HTMLButtonElement,\n\t  React.PropsWithChildren\u003CButtonProps>\n>(\n  (btnProps: ButtonProps & typeof defaultProps, ref:\n  React.ref\u003CHTMLButtonElement | null>)\n  ) => {\n\t// ...custom logic and destructuring here...\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t\u003CButton\n\t\t\tas={htmlType}\n\t\t\tref={buttonRef}\n\t\t\ttype={htmlType}\n\t\t\tclassName={className}\n\t\t\tdisabled={disabled}\n\t\t\tonClick={handleClick}\n\t\t>\n\t\t{loading && \u003CSpinner/>}\n\t\t{!!prefix && \u003Cspan className={styles.prefix[size]}>{prefix}\u003C/span>}\n\t\t{children}\n\t\t{!!suffix && \u003Cspan className={styles.suffix[size]}>{suffix}\u003C/span>}\n\t\t\u003C/Button>\n\t)\n  }\n)\n```\n\nStyles example, custom logic or variants (depending on your library of choice) are marked with `{}`:\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers title=\"button.tsx\"\nconst Button = styled('button', {\n\tbox-sizing: 'border-box',\n\tdisplay: 'inline-block',\n\tborder-radius: {radius},\n\tline-height: {SCALES.height(2.5)},\n\tfont-weight: {weight},\n\tfont-size: {SCALES.font(0.75)},\n\tjustify-content: 'center',\n\twhite-space: 'nowrap',\n\ttext-align: 'center',\n\ttransition: 'background-color 200ms ease 0ms, box-shadow 200ms ease 0ms, border 200ms ease 0ms, color 200ms ease 0ms',\n\tposition: 'relative',\n\toverflow: 'hidden',\n\tcolor: {color},\n\tbackground-color: {bg},\n\tcursor: {cursor},\n\tpointer-events: {events},\n\tborder: `1px solid ${border}`,\n\twidth: {auto ?

As for me, my initial contact with it happened at the tender age of four, and quite predictably, everything started from video games. Hours went by into thin air as I played Test Drive Unlimited demo repeatedly.\n\n## Discovering the power of Computers\n\nContrary to most people, my intrigue peaked where imagination and reality met. I could never align with the dystopia of something like Star Wars. Instead I was into driving games, imagining that I drive that car IRL. The same rationale extended to the likes of GTA - where I always made different scenarios in my mind, like being a cop, even though all I was doing was just free roaming, while all the missions were waiting for me. \n\nThat is why I love computers - they allow me to project my imagination beyond real life, and have instant access to whatever my mind wanders to.\n\nFast forward a few years, and my gaming was aimed at two specific games: Minecraft and Fifa. Little did I know that because of them, I would start my design career. \n\n## Starting my Design Career\n\nIn my attempt to create my own Fifa cover, I stumbled upon Photoshop CS6, after trying sketchy editors on the web. Soon I have found myself diving into Minecraft design projects that included thumbnails, banners, and more for YouTube. Entered Romanian design community, learned a bit of 3D using Cinema 4D, manipulating Minecraft skins, extruding and making different scenery. I learned how to color grade, use typography and more using Photoshop.\n\nMy desktop from back in 2015 sums everything up pretty nicely:\n\n\n\u003Cimg\n  alt='desktop'\n  src=\"/static/images/games-to-programming/desktop.jpg\"\n  \n  \n/>\n\n\nCheck out an example of a small rig I made:\n\n\u003Cimg\n  alt='minecraft rig'\n  src=\"/static/images/games-to-programming/minecraft.png\"\n  \n  \n/>\n\n\n\nAfter two years of immersing myself in design, an accidental post of a Messi fan-art in a FC Barcelona Facebook group led to unexpected opportunities to work as an editor with various pages. This experience allowed me to make new friends, enhance my design skills, and dip my toes in marketing.\n\nCheck out one of my posts:\n\n\u003Cimg\n  alt='oeif'\n  src=\"/static/images/games-to-programming/oeif.png\"\n  \n  \n/>\n\n\nYou can find more designs on my [behance post](https://www.behance.net/gallery/123166235/Football-Designs-Social-Media-Ora-Exacta-In-Fotbal?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cora+exacta+in+fotbal).\n\n## Getting into Programming\n\nAs I stepped into high school, I took a small break from design to focus on C++ and the challenge of competitive programming. However, escalating frustration from less-than-desirable results prompted me to pivot.\n\nSimultaneously, I joined my local [FTC Robotics Team](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). This collective improved my engineering and CAD design skills while teaching valuable lessons in team management and prolific competition participation. It was basically like running a small company. We won numerous awards, and I also won the [Dean's List Finalist Award]().\n\nPost 9th grade, I decided to revisit my passion for design - this time with boosted skills:\n\n\u003Cimg\n  alt='new design'\n  src=\"/static/images/games-to-programming/2021.png\"\n  \n  \n/>\n\nA web app winning first place in a hackathon I participated in triggered a eureka moment for me. Why not combine my design aptitude with programming and explore web development?\n\nFor a entire year, I just practiced , built projects, watched tutorials, took [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) by Harvard and [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) from MIT. You can see a lot of tried side-projects on [GitHub](). I randomly decided to join Twitter, where I posted my endeavors, slowly building my online presence. \n\n## Getting my first real results\n\nAs a testament to my persistent efforts, I bagged my first job as a designer at [Landmarks](https://landmarks.ro/) in November 2021. My work there thought me to design efficiently, while gaining essential skills for large-scale project execution.\n\nTwitter brought my work to the attention of numerous employers, leading to my current role at [Deta](https://deta.space/), where I am diving deep into design works for almost two years!\n\n### Morale\n\nMorale of this story is that life is wonderfully unpredictable.Who would have thought that one computer gifted at four would influence my career options at ten and fourteen?\n\nGo with the flow - you never know how today links to your future.\n\nLife is just a coin flip - it lands on heads or tails. Problem is that you do not know which is good or bad in the present moment. The beautiful thing is that you do not know which is good or bad in the present moment.\n\nThanks for reading.

If you don't know anything about those, don't worry, we'll go over them soon.\n\n## Complete Beginner\n\n\u003Cimg\n  alt='macbook'\n  src=\"/static/images/learn-web/beginner.jpg\"\n  \n  \n/>\n\n> You're new to coding? You haven't written a single line of code? Perfect. This is the place to start.\n> You have some experience and want to go just to the good stuff? Skip this section.\n\nFirst of all, welcome! You've chosen the right path and the right place. It's going to be a bit longer than usual, but it will all be worth it in the end.\n\nJust google \"learn to code\" and you will be overwhelmed by all the websites and resources. When learning to code by yourself, there is a big trap - you focus on things that don't matter, you find bad resources, you enter the [Tutorial Hell](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/tutorial-hell-how-can-you-escape-it-8a6a7da3ae08) and in the end, you don't make any progress.\n\nI created a roadmap, based on my experience and curated a **good** list of resources, for you.\n\nFirst of all, you need to learn some [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/). Ok, what the hell do Data Structures and Algorithms have in common with Web Development? What's wrong with you?\n\nYou don't need to freak out - at a first glance, they have no correlations - but in the long run, you will appreciate them. Why? Because they are the **_building blocks_** of your programming career. No matter where you end up: Mobile Development, Web Development, Machine Learning, Data Scientist, etc. those algorithms help you think logically and develop your **coding mind**.\n\n> The language doesn't matter, but make sure you choose a [Lower level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) language, like C, C++. Avoid at the start Python, Javascript, etc. because you'll end up using tools without knowing what they do under the hood.\n\nHere are some good resources for you:\n\n- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)\n- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)\n- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)\n- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)\n\nOk, those are a lot, and very comprehensive resources, I feel you. If you want to learn as much as possible in the shortest period, try [_Harvard's CS50_](https://cs50.harvard.edu)**. I completed the full **_FREE_\\*\\* course and I can proudly say that it built my foundation in programming. It is going to be hard, but stick to it and you'll never regret it. It teaches you the basics of DSA, and even real-world applications, web applications, security, and even mobile apps. You can watch, read, listen to the course, and it involves a really good grading system.\n\nAfter this, all you have to do is to practice some [LeetCode](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/) and [HackerRank](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/) problems, and you're set. (If you like Data Structures and Algorithms, you could try practicing on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), and even learn more about [Competitive Programming](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/49157))\n\n_Optional_: If you are a student, you could benefit A LOT from the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) - it offers you a lot of real-world tools. For your use case, **_Interview Cake_** is also an awesome resource for you. Teaching everything to make sure you land a job at Google, Apple, or other Silicon Valley companies. With the Github Student Developer Pack, you get a free 3 weeks of Interview Cake.\n\n> Great, now you're set to learn web development - with the help of this chapter, your journey will be a lot easier.\n\n## The Basics\n\nWelcome to HTML, CSS, and Javascript my friend! This is how the web skeleton is built for a simple website. Now it's the time to learn a new technique, **to learn** - and that is ... **_TO BUILD PROJECTS, LOTS OF THEM_**.\n\nIf you memorized Algorithms in the last chapter (that's not good!), this time that will not be possible. You can't memorize a whole website. You need to learn, by doing, by building, and by creating projects.\n\nFirst of all, you should learn HTML and CSS, and you have 2 options:\n\n- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)\n- [Youtube Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=html+css+crash+course) **_!!! TUTORIAL HELL !!!_**\n\nThe first option is much better. You go at your own pace. W3 Schools offers 2 great things: full-fledged documentation and exercises. Both are awesome. It should take you about half an hour for reading and half an hour for solving the exercises. Those 2 are just perfect for learning HTML, CSS, and every other language!\n\n> Now it's time to build some projects! Hooray! Try building 2 or 3 simple websites, [Landing Pages](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/), or any other simple site you want to build. You just have to build it yourself (of course, googling along the way any errors you may encounter).\n\nLastly, you'll learn Javascript, a Love it or Hate it language, but that is very powerful. As with the previous two, you should learn JS from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com).\n\n> Project time, now combine all 3 of your powers and build an awesome site, with lots of functionalities and beautiful design.\n\n> Good Job, you've become a web _coder_.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nWhat is this section for? Well, we'll move on to some **_interesting things_**, and you need general knowledge about the web before we reach them.\n\nWelcome to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)! This is probably the best resource for developers - complex and easy to understand.\n\nYou should read [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) and if you want, broaden your knowledge with their roadmap and resources.\n\n## Web frameworks\n\nFirst of all, a lot of people say that frameworks are \"bloated\" or that they don't need to be used for some application. They are wrong, the keyword is application. If you want to make a simple website, there's no need to use some framework, it could be made easily with HTML/CSS/JS. The frameworks are good on big applications, large codebases - the names of Facebook and Instagram. They can make the code easier to understand and provide numerous improvements for the app, lazy loading, server-side rendering, and many more.\n\n> Just think what Facebook would look like in plain HTML/CSS/JS? How many lines of code would they need, and how many people would understand the code afterward?\n\nThat's where frameworks come in and improve developer productivity. Now, there are a lot of debates as to what's the best framework, but I think the [2021 StackOverflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#overview) should be able to answer that.\n\n\u003Cimg\n  alt='survey'\n  src=\"/static/images/learn-web/survey.png\"\n  \n  \n/>\n\nThe 3 Kings are ReactJs, Angular, and Vue. I chose, alongside many other developers, React. Angular is developed and used by Google, but it has a really hard learning curve, while React was built by Facebook, and is used by Facebook, Uber, etc. Vue is the youngest out of the three, and someday, it may beat React, but for now, React is the web framework winner.\n\nThis blog was built using NextJs, a framework on top of React but with 80% React functionality.\n\nNow, where could you learn React?\n\nYou should do [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) mini-course from React, that should teach you the basics, and after that .. you just build more and more projects.\n\nLearn the [React-Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and then build applications, from simple to complex.\n\nA great place for React is youtube, and here are some awesome creators:\n\n- [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKsymTY_4BYR-wytLjex7A) | perfect for entry and simple projects, optimal for learning react\n- [Suboptimal Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeUeYvS8xb0iRxegIMxkX-w) | informative and very useful tutorials\n- [Sonny Sangha](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqeTj_QAnNlmt7FwzNwHZnA) |\n  _code along with Sonny 3 - 4 Clones and you'll be the React King_\n- [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA) |\n  _not only for react, but for web development in general, Fireship brings a lot of quality in his content_\n- [Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU-1X402kT-JlLdAitxSMA) | Javascript king\n\nCheck out my [github repositories](https://github.com/cristicretu?tab=repositories) and see that I made around 15-20 projects before I could call myself good in React.\n\n> Congratulations, now you know React - but build more projects.\n\n## CSS Frameworks\n\nI hope you figured out that frameworks are awesome and why developers love them.\nWell in this section, I'll introduce you to a CSS Framework that will make you forget about Vanilla CSS.\n\nThere are a lot of frameworks for CSS, like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [Chakra ui](https://chakra-ui.com) or [UIKit](https://getuikit.com).\n\nBut for me, and many other developers, the best framework is [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).\n\n\u003Cimg\n  alt='survey'\n  src=\"/static/images/learn-web/tailwind.png\"\n  \n  \n/>\n\nImagine that you'll never leave the HTML to create a new style and you'll never waste your time naming classes and ids. THIS IS TAILWIND CSS. Short, easy to understand abbreviations, great support, and a lot of functionality.\n\nUsing Tailwind will improve your speed significantly and now styling apps is no more a headache!\n\n## Beyond this post\n\nThank you for reading everything! This has been my take on web development.\nFor any suggestions or modifications reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cristicrtu).\n\n> One key thing to take away: DON'T STOP LEARNING! BUILD MORE AND MORE PROJECTS - that's the best way to learn new things.\n\nAfter all of those, you can learn more and more technologies, like [NextJS]() - if you took the React Route - Next is a very powerful framework and you can see why run the [PageInsights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) and my page and see the results. Yeah, that's NextJS.\n\nI look forward to talking with you, and about your career.\n\nYou never know where you end up.\nThis is a summary of my career so far:\n\n- Discovered Photoshop, graphic design, I was sure I was going to be a designer\n- Discovered Game Development, I was sure I was going to be a game developer\n- Discovered Algorithms and Data Structures, I was sure I was going to be a competitive programmer\n- Discovered Mobile Development with Xcode and Swift, I said that was it\n- Discovered Web Development and **_I am sure that I will become a full stack developer_**, for now, 😅\n\nSo given that, push ahead, do whatever you like and you enjoy, and you'll end up in a place, just perfect for you.","src/content/writing/learn-web.mdx","f72c4a10908e48cf","learn-web.mdx","look-where-you-aim",{"id":188,"data":190,"body":194,"filePath":195,"digest":196,"legacyId":197,"deferredRender":22},{"title":191,"publishedAt":192,"summary":83,"image":193},"look where you aim","2024-07-22","/static/images/look-where-you-aim/black.webp","I think that one of the most overlooked yet crucial principles for achieving success is the concept of unwavering visual focus *only* at what you want to attain. Seems logical right? Well, its consistent application is remarkably rare among individuals.\n\nConsider for a moment, the fundamental necessity of having a clear, scoped destination -- a goal. The mere act of establishing such an objective already distinguishes you in the top quintile of people. However, the true differentiator relies in the fact that you have to block out / metaphorically cognitively screening out all the negative influences, and all the paths that will move you only further away from your goal. Essentially you need to have a tunnel vision towards it.\n\nA great analogy for this principle can be found whilst driving a car. Experienced drivers instinctively understand the importance of **visual anticipation**. The skill of cornering -- fixing the gaze on the desired exit point of a turn rather than on an immediate object -- aka. \"look-ahead steering\", is a fundamental part of driving.\n\nNovice drivers, on the other hand, often make the mistake of focusing counterintuitively on potential obstacles - in order to avoid them - paradoxically increasing the chance of an accident. This phenomenon is referred to as \"target fixation\" - shows off the importance of visual focus.\n\nBy consciously directing our attention towards our objectives and filtering out distractions, we can guarantee success.","src/content/writing/look-where-you-aim.mdx","5a570d44e733253c","look-where-you-aim.mdx","luck",{"id":198,"data":200,"body":204,"filePath":205,"digest":206,"legacyId":207,"deferredRender":22},{"title":201,"publishedAt":126,"summary":202,"image":203},"LUCK","what is luck, really?","/static/images/luck/bg.jpg","luck is a concept that is often misunderstood. it is not a mystical force that randomly bestows good fortune upon people.\na lot of 'overnight successes' are actually months, years, decades in the making.\n\nfocus on yourself - grow, fail, fail, fail, and fail, learn and never stop going.\neventually, you're going to get rewarded in unimaginable ways, such that you would feel almost guilty for it.\n\ni feel like a lot of people are waiting for luck to come to them, but it's the other way around.\n\nluck is a byproduct of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. it is not something that can be obtained by chance alone.\n\nmost of the times, you know you *created your luck* when you're receiving _guerdons_ so easily compared to your peers, that it feels like you're cheating in some way.\n\n[never stop trying.](https://x.com/danielvandalen/status/1795344561994444947)\n\nmoral of the story is **to create your own luck**.","src/content/writing/luck.mdx","f5a27511f7d6a436","luck.mdx","performance",{"id":208,"data":210,"body":215,"filePath":216,"digest":217,"legacyId":218,"deferredRender":22},{"title":211,"publishedAt":212,"summary":213,"image":214},"On performance","2023-05-25","How to achieve peak performance.","/static/images/performance/mozart.png","An essay on life performance.\n- sleep is the no. 1 prio\n  - do not read this if you should sleep now\n- no. 2 is breaking the routine barrier\n  - this means exercise (pain), or walk (different spaces), or staying in nature (feel)\n- no. 3 is hidration + diet\n  - drink more water than you think you need\n  - don't eat bad food in a chain\n- take care of your brain\n  - read anything, books, publications, blog posts, [Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/)\n  - learn new things, new skills, new languages\n  - read something new & different each day\n  - write, and dump anything & everything you have in your brain on a piece of paper\n  - do a [NSDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKGrmY8OSHM) mid-day, before 3 pm to \"restart\" your day\n- do not neglect social life, we are social animals\n  - talk to people, friends, family, and strangers\n  - go out, do something, anything\n  - do not stay in the same place for too long\n- remember, life is just **[normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)**.\n  - to get to the peak performance, you have to get through the parabola of stress (where you'll beat yourself up if you miss something from your routine), then fall into the valley of despair, then finally make up your structure, based on what you accumulated in the previous two slopes.\n\n\u003Cimg\n  alt='The Bell Curve'\n  src=\"/static/images/performance/shapes.png\"\n  \n  \n  className='rounded-lg'\n/>\n  \n  - do not overthink it, just go with the flow\n  - do not overthink it, just go with the flow\n  - do not overthink it, just go with the flow","src/content/writing/performance.mdx","a453210d2969f036","performance.mdx","sam-altman",{"id":219,"data":221,"body":226,"filePath":227,"digest":228,"legacyId":229,"deferredRender":22},{"title":222,"publishedAt":223,"summary":224,"image":225},"A synopsis of Sam Altman","2023-07-04","Some key points on how to bring in value.","/static/images/sam-altman/sam.webp","Do a check-in for yourself, and see if you’re working on what you should be working on.

The App Store Connect bullshit, the icons, the screenshots, the metadata - that took longer. And marketing? Marketing is a full-time job pretending to be a side task.

The best architecture with zero users is worthless.\n- Do the simplest thing that could possibly work. You can always add complexity. You can't always subtract it.\n- Research is procrastination wearing a lab coat. Build something, watch it break, fix it.\n\nOn marketing:\n\n- It's not a side quest. It's the main quest. Code is the easy part.\n- Nobody is posting. Everyone is consuming. The bar for standing out is low if you just show up consistently.\n\nOn learning:\n\n- The smartest people are self-taught even if they went to school. Credentials get you in the door. Skill keeps you in the room.\n- You can learn anything. The \"too late\" thing is a cope.\n\nOn mindset:\n\n- Your plan is always smaller than what's possible. Most limitations are self-imposed.\n- You get what you believe you deserve. Sounds like woo but watch how you negotiate, how you price yourself, how you ask for things. It's there.\n- The cold water doesn't get warmer if you jump late.\n- Everyone is figuring it out as they go. The people who look like they know? Better actors.\n\n\nThanks for sticking with me this year. You the real one.\n\n## 2026\n\nThis year is going to skyrocket. \n\nMore vinculum. More shipping. Less overthinking.\n\n10x the output. 1000x the results. \n\nSee you next year.","src/content/writing/2025.mdx","052ca7e06ceddd74","2025.mdx"]
